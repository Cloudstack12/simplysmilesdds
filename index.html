                    <br>

                <h2>What Is Dental Hygiene?</h2>
                <p>
                    According to one Delta Dental survey, 2% of people don't brush their teeth at all and another 29% only brush once a day. Luckily, 55% of people brush the recommended twice a day for 2 minutes. <br>
                    <br>
                    Regularly brushing and flossing your teeth removes plaque which, if left on too long, will harden into tartar. Only a dental professional can remove tartar. Untreated tartar buildup can cause cavities, tooth decay, and possible tooth loss. <br>
                    <br>
                    Here are a few more reasons why investing in your dental hygiene is really an investment in your health. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b style="font-size: medium;">Oral Hygiene and Overall Health Are Connected</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    Did you know that the health of your mouth directly impacts your overall health and wellbeing? That's because your mouth acts as a gateway to the rest of your body. It's also the first place systemic diseases present themselves. <br>
                    <br>
                    For example, diabetes can start as a sore, mouth lesion, or gum disease. Patients with gum disease (or periodontal disease) are at greater risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, or stroke. <br>
                    <br>
                    When your gums are inflamed, it can cause chronic inflammation in other parts of your body as well, including the arteries that lead to your heart. Other health issues caused by poor dental hygiene include: <br>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bacterial pneumonia</li>
                        <li>Cancer</li>
                        <li>Sepsis</li>
                        <li>Complications during pregnancy or low birth weight</li>
                        <br>
                    </ul>
                    <b style="font-size: medium;">Early Detection</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    Early detection is key when diagnosing and treating any major health issue, including oral cancer. Without regular dental visits, you could develop a serious health risk and not even know it. <br>
                    <br>
                    The earlier you spot the warning signs, the more likely you are to find a simple and effective treatment. If an issue arises between visits, never hesitate to call and <a href="https://www.simplysmilesdds.com/emergency-dentist-ashburn-va">schedule an emergency appointment</a> . <br>
                    <br>
                    <b style="font-size: medium;">Create an Oral Treatment Plan for the Future</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    Once you visit a dentist in Ashburn, VA, you can establish a relationship and create a treatment plan moving forward. This may include addressing specific issues or simply coming in for routine cleanings. <br>   
                    <br>
                    When it comes time to treat an oral issue, your dentist can create a plan that meets your individual needs and budget. You can also request additional consultations for dental work and cosmetic procedures. <br>
                    <br>
                    These may include but aren't limited to: <br>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Teeth whitening</li>
                        <li>Invisalign</li> 
                        <li>Veneers</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.simplysmilesdds.com/dental-implants-ashburn-va">Dental implants</a></li>
                        <br>
                    </ul>
                    <b style="font-size: medium;">Prevent Tooth Loss</b> <br>   
                    <br>
                    One way to avoid the need for the above-mentioned procedures is by preventing tooth loss in the first place. According to the <a href="https://www.prosthodontics.org/assets/1/7/ACP_Talking_points_for_Missing_Teeth_1-12-15.pdf">American College of Prosthodontists</a>  (ACP), 178 million Americans are missing at least one tooth and 40 million are missing all of their teeth. <br>
                    <br>
                    Periodontal disease along with poor dental hygiene is the leading cause of tooth loss in adults. When plaque builds up on your teeth and turns into tartar, it can cause severe tooth decay and gum infections. <br>
                    <br>
                    By practicing good dental hygiene and seeing your dentist regularly, you can prevent plaque buildup. Brushing and flossing at home are the first steps to maintaining good oral health. Scheduling a cleaning with your dentist in Ashburn, VA, will help remove hard-to-reach plaque and tartar along the gum line. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b style="font-size: medium;">Boost Your Confidence</b> <br>    
                    <br>
                    No one wants crooked or stained teeth, bad breath, or missing teeth. Studies show that the health and beauty of your smile directly impact your self-confidence and overall level of happiness. <br>
                    <br>
                    Tackle life with a bright, white smile that shows the world just how confident you are! The appearance of your smile not only affects your self-esteem but how successful you are both personally and professionally. <br>

                <h2>Tips for Maintaining Good Oral Health and Hygiene</h2>
                <p>
                    Now that you know the importance of maintaining good dental hygiene, here are a few more tips on how you can invest in those pearly whites. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b style="font-size: medium;">Avoid Sugary Snacks and Drinks</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    When you consume too much sugar, plaque bacteria in your mouth produce acid which, over time, attacks your tooth enamel. Enamel is the hard surface that covers and protects your teeth. Once it wears away, you can never get it back. <br>
                    <br>
                    Carbonated and sports drinks, coffee, tea, and sugary desserts and candies can all break down tooth enamel. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b style="font-size: medium;">Avoid Tobacco</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    While it's no secret that smoking cigarettes are bad for your overall health, this habit can also cause a long list of oral health issues. Tobacco stains your teeth, giving them a yellowish tint and killing their natural shine. It can also lead to more plaque and tartar buildup. <br>
                    <br>
                    Your gums are also negatively affected by tobacco use. Smoking causes a lack of oxygen in your bloodstream, making it increasingly difficult for gum infections to heal. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b style="font-size: medium;">Rinse with Water or Chew Sugarless Gum</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    Although it may surprise you that <a href="https://www.simplysmilesdds.com/about-our-team">a dentist in Ashburn, VA</a> , would recommend chewing gum, doing so between meals increases saliva, thereby reducing plaque acid and tooth decay. Sugarless gum may also help strengthen your teeth and act as a replacement when brushing isn't possible. <br>
                    <br>
                    You can also rinse with water between meals to remove any food debris stuck between your teeth. <br>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Invest in Your Dental Hygiene Today</h2>
                    Investing in your dental hygiene is an investment in your <a href="https://www.simplysmilesdds.com/smiling-benefits">overall health and happiness</a> . While going to the dentist might seem daunting, it's important to get routine dental exams and cleanings. <br>
                    <br>
